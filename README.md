# Mind.org.uk 27 Miles in 27 Days
Welcome!  This repository contains the source code for the small web app that I have built to track progress of a charity running event that myself and a good friend are partaking in.  The live site is available at [run.soton.rocks](https://run.soton.rocks)

## Why, who and how?
This March, societies from the University of Southampton be running 27 miles in 27 days in solidarity of the 27% of students who report a mental health problem whilst at university.More students are experiencing mental health problems than ever before. The number of students reporting a mental health problem is five times greater today than it was ten years ago, while the number of students dropping out because of mental health problems has trebled. Every student taking part in the 27 27 challenge is sending a clear message: its time to take our mental health seriously, and we wont give up until everyone with a mental health problem gets support and respect.

We'd really appreciate donations to our cause, Mind has been a crucial charity to me and remains so to this day - if you feel you are able to support us, you can use the following links:

## Technology
After building a quick mockup in Figma, we used NextJS (React) & TailwindCSS to build the app - it remains my favourite frontend "stack" due to it's incredible developer utility.

In addition to this, we're also making use of the JustGiving and Google Sheets APIs to pull in the relevant data on page load - this allows a nice dynamic count-up effect.
